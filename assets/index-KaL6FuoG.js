They are widely used in regenerative medicine, immune modulation, and tissue repair.",q2:"What are the main applications of mesenchymal stem cell therapy?",a2:"They are mainly used to treat arthritis, bone injuries, heart disease, diabetes, and skin repair. They are also applied in aesthetic medicine for anti-aging and improving skin quality.",q3:"Are there any side effects of stem cell therapy?",a3:"Stem cell therapy is generally safe, but mild side effects such as local swelling, allergic reactions, or redness may occur, usually resolving shortly after treatment.",q4:"What are the advantages of stem cell therapy in Japan?",a4:"Japan has advanced research and clinical applications in stem cell therapy, particularly MSC therapy for aging and joint injuries. With 43 years of research, and regulations established by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare since May 2013, Japan offers extensive clinical experience and a well-developed legal framework ensuring safety.",q5:"How long does it take to see results from MSC therapy?",a5:"Results vary per individual. Typically, improvements can be seen within a few months to a year, especially for skin quality or joint issues.",q6:"Is stem cell therapy suitable for everyone?",a6:"Stem cell therapy is not suitable for everyone, particularly patients with immune disorders, pregnant women, or those with certain chronic diseases. Consultation with a doctor is required before treatment.",q7:"What is the cost of stem cell therapy?",a7:"The cost is relatively high and varies depending on the treatment, hospital, and region. It generally ranges from several tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of RMB.",q8:"Can stem cell therapy replace surgery?",a8:"Stem cell therapy cannot completely replace surgery. However, for early or mild cases, it can be an effective supplement or alternative to surgery."},aesthetic:{title:"Aesthetic Medicine",q1:"What is the difference between Japan's skin booster injections and those in China?",a1:"Japanese skin booster injections usually use higher-purity hyaluronic acid combined with multiple antioxidants, focusing on gentle and natural effects. Japanese doctors are precise in operation, carefully controlling injection layers and dosage, resulting in faster recovery and more hydrated, radiant skin.",q2:"Which is more effective, Thermage or Ultherapy in Japan?",a2:"Thermage uses radiofrequency to stimulate collagen regeneration for visible tightening, suitable for sagging skin. Ultherapy uses high-intensity focused ultrasound targeting the fascia layer, providing longer-lasting lifting effects. Japanese doctors emphasize personalized treatment and recommend in-person consultation to choose the best option.",q3:"How does eyelid surgery in Japan differ from China?",a3:"Japanese eyelid surgery is known for precision and natural results. Doctors design according to individual eye shapes to avoid over-surgery. The common 'Korean-style point method' is more refined in Japan, with smaller incisions, faster recovery, and a natural outcome.",q4:"Are there differences in hyaluronic acid used in Japan vs. China?",a4:"Japanese clinics often use high-end brands like Juvederm and Restylane, with more stable molecular structures for longer-lasting effects. Doctors perform delicate, layered injections to ensure a natural and soft result.",q5:"Is it worth doing photorejuvenation in Japan?",a5:"Japan uses advanced photorejuvenation devices such as M22 and IPL, with treatments tailored to different skin issues. The procedures are gentle but long-lasting, with precise operation and complete post-treatment care, ideal for natural whitening and smooth skin."},healthCheck:{title:"Health Checkups",q1:"Why are health checkups important for health management?",a1:"Health checkups help detect health issues early, especially chronic and cardiovascular diseases. Timely intervention can prevent disease progression and maintain overall health.",q2:"What are the features of health checkups in Japan?",a2:"Japanese health checkups are comprehensive, including routine examinations, cancer screening, cardiac evaluation, bone density tests, and more. They focus on detailed health management and early diagnosis. DWIBS is an advanced cancer screening tool, more precise than PET-CT, without contrast injection or radiation, detecting tumors smaller than 2mm. Virtual gastrointestinal CT can examine the digestive tract without anesthesia or endoscope insertion.",q3:"Which tests are essential in a checkup?",a3:"Essential tests include cancer screening, gastrointestinal exams, blood pressure, blood glucose, lipid profile, liver and kidney function, ECG, and chest X-ray. Additional tests can be added per doctor’s advice.",q4:"Can checkups detect all health issues?",a4:"Checkups can detect most common health issues but cannot cover all diseases, especially hidden conditions that may require specialized tests or long-term monitoring.",q5:"How to choose the right checkup package?",a5:"Consider age, gender, family history, and lifestyle habits. Those with genetic risk factors, smoking, or drinking habits should choose targeted exams. Selection should ideally be guided by a doctor."},latest:{publicTime:"Published on",customer_milestone:{title:"Record Number of Clients Served",content:"We are proud to announce that JinTai International Health Co., Ltd. has successfully provided medical services to over 1,000 clients, helping them achieve their health goals.
